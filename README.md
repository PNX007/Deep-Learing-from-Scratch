# Deep-Learing-from-Scratch
This book is an introductory book in the true sense of deep learning. It analyzes the principles and related technologies of deep learning in a simple way. Using Python 3 in the book, try not to rely on external libraries or tools to lead the reader to create a classic deep learning network from scratch, so that readers can gradually understand deep learning in the process. The book not only introduces the basic knowledge of deep learning and neural network concepts, features, but also provides an in-depth explanation of error back propagation method, convolutional neural network, etc. Practical practical skills, automatic driving, image generation, reinforcement learning, etc., and why the deepening layer can improve the "why" of recognition accuracy. This book is suitable for deep learning beginners to read, but also can be used as a college textbook.
